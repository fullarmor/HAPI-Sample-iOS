# HAPI-Sample-iOS
Sample iOS App demonstrating the use of HAPI APIs

This sample iOS app is written using Swift in XCode and demonstrates how to use HAPI to login, navigate files and folder published in Active Directory, download a file to the device, and upload a local device file into Active Directory. The app was written in Swift using XCode 6.4, requires framework in iOS 5.0 and later. By default, the app makes calls to the HAPI Gatekeeper in our sandbox environment, which is supported by a HAPI Gateway and sandbox Active Directory instance. FullArmor can supply a temporary sandbox Active Directory account, complete with sample data, upon request.
